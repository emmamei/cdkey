SERVER SIDE
-----------

This is the code relating to the update server and the backend
server processing. This backend is no longer used by the key,
but could be reimplemented or phased in.

In particular, the update key process could be reimplmented.

It may be better just to utilize in-world technologies to
pass a key update to a key wearer; this will be examined
in days to come.
