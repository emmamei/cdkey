COMMUNITY DOLLS KEY
===================

The Community Dolls Key is a wearable doll key that focuses on
public use of the dolly and building community. It uses RLV
features in your viewer to impose constraints upon the dolly.

What Makes the Community Doll Key Unique?
-----------------------------------------

There are primarily two sorts of keys in the SL marketplace
today: ornamental keys, and BDSM keys.

The ornamental key is about beauty and magnificience - it has
no power over the wearer. It is a decoration and something to be
admired.

The BDSM key is about restrictions and control. In the visual
and RP realms, it is a _working_ key: when dolly runs out of
time, dolly stops. These keys impose a control over the dolly
by its owner.

The Community Dolls Key is different from both of these.
The Key is a _working_ key, like the BDSM keys - but it is
not about control and restrictions, though those are possible.
The Key is about making friends, building community, and
making one "reach outside" of themselves to others.

How Does the Community Doll Key Realize Its Purpose?
----------------------------------------------------

In contrast to other keys, the Community Dolls Key has a large
emphasis on making _others_ wind you and play with you. Thus,
the public access to a Community Doll is much greater than it is
for a typical BDSM key.

The public at large can:
* Wind the Doll
* Dress the Doll
* Carry the Doll
* Pose the Doll
* Change the Doll Type
* Strip the Doll (with restrictions)

No other Key provides this set of features to the public. These
items can also be turned off by the Doll selectively to protect
themselves during SL work times or other moments.
