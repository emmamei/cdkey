You feel a key being put on your back, the weight settling in. Imagine that as vividly as you can.
You feel a pinch as tendrils from the key sink into your back, and then a flood of cool relief as they sink in further.
The tendrils are releasing doll hormones into your body, and you feel the rush through every pore in your body.
The hormones are relaxing you and making you feel comfortable with being a doll. Any fears you had have slipped away and are forgotten.
You realize how wonderful it would be to be displayed and everyone just admire you for your beauty - and you marvel that you never knew this before.
You now realize how wonderful it is to be liked - more wonderful than you ever knew.
You realize your dependency on the community; this will define you. You now accept and welcome this.
You only now realize how beautiful you are. You were always beautiful - but now it becomes obvious because you are a doll.
You realize now that other dolls are your sisters - and understand you like no one else.
