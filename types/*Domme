Your brain wants to control people
You feel guilty not controlling people
Your heart needs to be obeyed
You know what people need
You need to control people so they will wind you
You need to control people so you can do good things
You need to control people so you will be happy
People who ignore you are unimportant
People who ignore you are stupid
People who obey you are good
People who follow you are good
People who want your guidance are good
