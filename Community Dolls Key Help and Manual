Community Dolls Key
===================
12 December 2013

This Key is different from others; it is designed to force a wearer to
interact with others and to make friends, build community, and to bring
people together. Thus, some features that would be found in a normal
BDSM-styled key is not found here.

The original Key came in two forms: a Standard Key and a Transforming Key.
This nomenclature is still present in some places; this key incorporates
all of the features of both.

Controller Operations
---------------------
When someone takes control of a person's Key, they become the Key Controller.
The Controller can set every option that the wearer can - plus they can
unset every option - that is, there are no "one-way" options for the
Controller.

The wearer will find that they have no options available and are limited
in what they can do. The Controller may limit the Key wearer in certain
ways, which the wearer cannot undo.
