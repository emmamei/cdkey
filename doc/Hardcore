HARDCORE MODE
=============
5 May 2021

The general idea behind hardcore mode is a few things:

    * Dolly can activate hardcore mode but cannot deactivate it
    * Dolly is not aware of the status of the Key or of time left
    * Dolly cannot turn off public options
    * Poses are silent and there is no time limit: Dolly remains posed until someone unposes Dolly
    * Dolly cannot dress or wind self
    * Key cannot be detached

Specifically, hardcore mode does a wide variety of things, and changes the Key's
operation in some interesting ways:

    * Dolly does not get reports of how much time is left or added
    * Dolly does not get reports of who accessed her and how
    * Dolly can enter hardcore mode but cannot exit
    * Controller (except Dolly) is the only one who can exit hardcore mode
    * Dolly cannot disallow the public from dressing her
    * Dolly cannot disallow the public from carrying her
    * Dolly cannot disallow the public from posing her
    * Dolly cannot disallow the public from stripping her
    * Poses no longer have time limits, regardless of doll type
    * Poses are silent - Dolly cannot speak during a pose
    * Dolly cannot dress self
    * Key is not detachable
    * stats related chat commands are disabled
