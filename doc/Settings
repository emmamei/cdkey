SET CONFIG Settings
===================
18 February 2015

There are many settings in the Key, and some time ago
a separate "channel" was set up to actually set these
configurations rather than to broadcast them over the
usual CONFIG channel. This allows a single procedure
to set the values as needed and then broadcast the result
to all the rest.

This prevents competing settings from coming about, as
there is then only one place where these settings will
be set.

This document is subject to considerable change, but
this is the current layout:

Aux.lsl
-------
* dollGender

ChatHandler.lsl
---------------
* chatChannel
* chatFilter

Main.lsl
--------
* keyLimit
* lastWinderID
* autoAfk
* afk
* timeLeftOnKey
* wearLock
* lowScriptMode
* poseExpire
* carryExpire
* jamExpire
* wearLockExpire

MenuHandler.lsl
---------------
* blacklist
* controllers

Transform.lsl
-------------
* dollType
* transformLockExpire
* outfitsFolder
