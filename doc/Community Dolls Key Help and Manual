Community Dolls Key
===================
12 December 2013

This Key is different from others; it is designed to force a wearer to
interact with others and to make friends, build community, and to bring
people together. Thus, some features that would be found in a normal
BDSM-styled key is not found here.

The original Key came in two forms: a Standard Key and a Transforming Key.
This nomenclature may be found in some places; this key incorporates
all of the features of both.

Configuration of #RLV Folder
----------------------------

The Key uses a folder called #RLV - you should create it in the top level
of your inventory (next to folders like "Clothing" and "Lost and Found")
if you haven't already. This folder is used by many items that utilise
RLV.

To be able to wear an item on demand, the Key uses a set of folders located
in #RLV. These folders will contain your outfits as well as your doll types.
With the proper set up, users of your Key can change your wear, as well as
your type.

The first thing is to create a "> Outfits" folder (without the quotes).
The folder is "marked" with a ">" symbol, which is a standard naming
convention in the #RLV folder. You can create a multi-level tree using this
convention inside your outfit folder.

Inside the #RLV folder you will need two specific folders:

Folder: ~normalself

This folder contains the items that you need for a basic "self" - shape,
skin, and hair for example. These items are only re-worn when a complete
avi change is detected; normally, the items in this folder are only put
on once.

Folder: ~nude

Items that may need to be put on frequently after an outfit - such as
bare feet, jewelry, tattoos, and such can be placed here. These items
are re-worn after every outfit change.


If the contents of both the ~normalself and ~nude folders are worn,
you should be in your "natural" nude state. This state may be used
as a basis for a "Nude" button in the future.

In the "> Outfits" folder, there will also be Doll Type folders.
These folders are marked by a leading "*" in their name, and have
a name that matches the Doll Type Notecard contained within the
Doll's Key. For instance, a Doll Type of Japanese will have a
notecard in the Key called "*Japanese" and a folder in the
"#RLV/> Outfits" folder called "*Japanese".

Outfits for general wear (or for a doll with the Regular Doll Type)
can be found in the "#RLV" folder itself or in subdirectories
thereof (when using the ">" convention). For example, one could
have a folder "#RLV/> Outfits/> Formal" and a folder within that
called "Red Gown" that has the items for a Red Gown in it.

Outfits stored in a Doll Type Folder are only shown to the doll
when the dolly is that type of doll. So items that are in the
"*Japanese" folder (including perhaps subfolders!) are only shown
when the doll is a "Japanese Doll".

Main Menu
---------

On the initial menu seen after a Key is touched are the following buttons:

    Wind: Wind up the dolly a certain amount, typically 30 minutes.

    Doll Type: Convert the dolly to a particular Type of Doll. This will
    provide the Doll with a select choice of outfits (if set up) for that
    Type, and will also send text affirmations and suggestions to the Doll
    pertaining to the Doll Type selected.

    Dress: This will dress the Doll in a chosen outfit. If the Doll is a
    specific Doll Type, and outfits are set up properly, then this list
    of outfits will be specific to the Type of Doll chosen.

    Options: these are Options that affect how the Doll operates and what
    restrictions they operate under. When Carried or when having a Controller,
    these options may change or be eliminated from the Wearer's consideration.

    Visible (or Invisible): This makes the Key vanish. The Key remains
    completely operational, and touchable - but it is Invisible. This can be
    useful for RP and for situations where the Key appears in the "wrong"
    place - such as poking through a chair or another person. The Key can
    also be made Visible again.

Carrier Operations
------------------

Controller Operations
---------------------
When someone takes control of a person's Key, they become the Key Controller.
The Controller can set every option that the wearer can - plus they can
unset every option - that is, there are no "one-way" options for the
Controller.

The wearer will find that they have no options available and are limited
in what they can do. The Controller may limit the Key wearer in certain
ways, which the wearer cannot undo.
