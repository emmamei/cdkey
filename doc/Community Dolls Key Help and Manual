Community Dolls Key
===================
12 December 2013

This Key is different from others; it is designed to force a wearer to
interact with others and to make friends, build community, and to bring
people together. Thus, some features that would be found in a normal
BDSM-styled key is not found here.

The original Key came in two forms: a Standard Key and a Transforming Key.
This nomenclature may be found in some places; this key incorporates
all of the features of both.

Configuration of #RLV Folder
----------------------------

The Key uses a folder called #RLV - you should create it in the top level
of your inventory (next to folders like "Clothing" and "Lost and Found")
if you haven't already. This folder is used by many items that utilise
RLV.

To be able to wear an item on demand, the Key uses a set of folders located
in #RLV. These folders will contain your outfits as well as your doll types.
With the proper set up, users of your Key can change your wear, as well as
your type.

The first thing is to create a "> Outfits" folder (without the quotes).
The folder is "marked" with a ">" symbol, which is a standard naming
convention in the #RLV folder. You can create a multi-level tree using this
convention inside your outfit folder.

Inside the #RLV folder you will need two specific folders:

Folder: ~normalself

This folder contains the items that you need for a basic "self" - shape,
skin, and hair for example. These items are only re-worn when a complete
avi change is detected; normally, the items in this folder are only put
on once.

Folder: ~nude

Items that may need to be put on frequently after an outfit - such as
bare feet, jewelry, tattoos, and such can be placed here. These items
are re-worn after every outfit change.


If the contents of both the ~normalself and ~nude folders are worn,
you should be in your "natural" nude state. This state may be used
as a basis for a "Nude" button in the future.

In the "> Outfits" folder, there will also be Doll Type folders.
These folders are marked by a leading "*" in their name, and have
a name that matches the Doll Type Notecard contained within the
Doll's Key. For instance, a Doll Type of Japanese will have a
notecard in the Key called "*Japanese" and a folder in the
"#RLV/> Outfits" folder called "*Japanese".

Outfits for general wear (or for a doll with the Regular Doll Type)
can be found in the "#RLV" folder itself or in subdirectories
thereof (when using the ">" convention). For example, one could
have a folder "#RLV/> Outfits/> Formal" and a folder within that
called "Red Gown" that has the items for a Red Gown in it.

Outfits stored in a Doll Type Folder are only shown to the doll
when the dolly is that type of doll. So items that are in the
"*Japanese" folder (including perhaps subfolders!) are only shown
when the doll is a "Japanese Doll".

Menus and Control
-----------------

The Menu structure is basically the same no matter who is accessing
the Key, but the specific items visible may change depending on options
and who it is that is accessing the Key.

There are four different people (or roles) that may access the Key at
any given time: the Doll herself, the Doll's Controller (or dominant or
owner), the Doll's Carrier, or the public at large.

A Doll with no Controller or Carrier has generally full access to all of
the options and capabilities contained in the Key. A Doll can submit to
a Controller, or a member of the public can Carry the Doll - both of
which will remove a large amount of options from the Doll's control.

A Controller will have more control than a Carrier, and the public
will see no loss of control - that is, the general public can still
wind the Dolly, dress her up, and more.

A Carrier takes control of the Dolly, and locks out the rest of the
general public from accessing the Dolly while the Carrier is carrying the
Doll.

Main Menu
---------

On the initial menu seen after a Key is touched are the following buttons:

    Wind
    
    Wind up the dolly a certain amount, typically 30 or 60 minutes. If
    there are multiple amounts that can be chosen, a new menu will appear
    with the choices available.

    Type of Doll
    
    Convert the dolly to a particular Type of Doll. This will provide the
    Doll with a select choice of outfits (if set up) for that Type, and
    will also send text affirmations and suggestions to the Doll pertaining
    to the Doll Type selected.

    Dress
    
    This will dress the Doll in a chosen outfit. If the Doll is a specific
    Doll Type, and outfits are set up properly, then this list of outfits
    will be specific to the Type of Doll chosen.

    Options
    
    The Options menu provides for a number of options that affect how the
    Doll operates and what restrictions they operate under. When Carried
    or when having a Controller, these options may change or be eliminated
    from the Wearer's consideration.

    Visible (or Invisible)
    
    This makes the Key vanish. The Key remains completely operational,
    and touchable - but it is Invisible. This can be useful for RP and
    for situations where the Key appears in the "wrong" place - such as
    poking through a chair or another person. The Key can also be made
    Visible again.

    Pose (and Unpose)

    A person may Pose a Dolly, in which case they will be locked into that
    pose for 5 minutes (unless they are a Display Dolly). The Doll cannot
    exit the pose unless they posed themselves. If the Pose Silence option
    is selected, the Doll is forced to be silent while posed (though IMs
    are still possible).

    Detach

    If the key is detachable, then this button appears in the main menu.
    Upon clicking this button, the Key will be detached and no longer available.

    Help/Support

    Help and Support is available for the Key here, including documentation.

    AFK

    If the Doll is AFK (or Away From Keyboard) then the Dolly operates at a
    reduced unwinding rate, and with moderate restrictions in place. It is
    a sort of "low-power" mode for Dolly.

Options Menu
------------

The Options menu has a number of sub-menus, all of which contain some setting
or another for the Key's operation.

    Type...

    Options relating to the Key Type and it's operation can be found here.

    Access...

    Options related to access to the Key itself are here, including adding
    and removing Controllers, as well as adding and removing people from
    a blacklist.

    Abilities...

    These are options that affect direct viewer operation and avatar control,
    otherwise known as RLV restrictions and operations.

    Features...

    These are options that affect general Key operation.

    Key...

    These are items like choosing the Key color and so on, relating to the
    physical attached Key.

Carrier Operations
------------------

Controller Operations
---------------------

When someone takes control of a person's Key, they become the Key Controller.
The Controller can set every option that the wearer can - plus they can
unset every option - that is, there are no "one-way" options for the
Controller.

The wearer will find that they have no options available and are limited
in what they can do. The Controller may limit the Key wearer in certain
ways, which the wearer cannot undo.

Wound Down Dolly
----------------

When wound down, the Dolly is severely restricted, but with one standard
notable exception: IM is fully unrestricted. A wound-down Dolly is not
a functioning Dolly - and thus cannot move or talk or any other thing that
requires a functioning Dolly. However, Dolls are living creatures and thus
can use their telepathy (or IMs) with the greater community to call for
help.
