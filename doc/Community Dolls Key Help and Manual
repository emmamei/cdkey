Community Dolls Key
===================
12 December 2013

This Key is different from others; it is designed to force a wearer to
interact with others and to make friends, build community, and to bring
people together. Thus, some features that would be found in a normal
BDSM-styled key is not found here.

The original Key came in two forms: a Standard Key and a Transforming Key.
This nomenclature is still present in some places; this key incorporates
all of the features of both.

Main Menu
---------

On the initial menu seen after a Key is touched are the following buttons:

    Wind: Wind up the dolly a certain amount, typically 30 minutes.

    Doll Type: Convert the dolly to a particular Type of Doll. This will
    provide the Doll with a select choice of outfits (if set up) for that
    Type, and will also send text affirmations and suggestions to the Doll
    pertaining to the Doll Type selected.

    Dress: This will dress the Doll in a chosen outfit. If the Doll is a
    specific Doll Type, and outfits are set up properly, then this list
    of outfits will be specific to the Type of Doll chosen.

    Options: these are Options that affect how the Doll operates and what
    restrictions they operate under. When Carried or when having a Controller,
    these options may change or be eliminated from the Wearer's consideration.

    Visible (or Invisible): This makes the Key vanish. The Key remains
    completely operational, and touchable - but it is Invisible. This can be
    useful for RP and for situations where the Key appears in the "wrong"
    place - such as poking through a chair or another person. The Key can
    also be made Visible again.

Controller Operations
---------------------
When someone takes control of a person's Key, they become the Key Controller.
The Controller can set every option that the wearer can - plus they can
unset every option - that is, there are no "one-way" options for the
Controller.

The wearer will find that they have no options available and are limited
in what they can do. The Controller may limit the Key wearer in certain
ways, which the wearer cannot undo.
